# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define *how* tools work. This file is for *your* specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases  
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice ID: `4e2d59bf-ba36-4ecf-ab3d-3e0b1b763dde`
- Auto-play: Enabled (`afplay`)
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

### TTS
- Preferred voice ID: `489b147d-b702-4625-961b-86f78f0d62ae`
- Auto-play: Enabled (`afplay`)
