# PRODUCTIVITY.md - Focus & Priorities

Optional scratch space for the day. You can edit this; the agent uses it when helping with "what to do" or planning.

## Today's focus
- *(Add 1–3 priorities or leave blank)*

## Blockers / notes
- *(Anything blocking you or worth remembering)*

---
When assisting with productivity, the agent reads: this file, `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, and `TODO.md` as needed.
